Inference from a Bayesian lens frames all problems about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. However, it is often difficult to actually analytically derive these probability density functions (PDF). Instead, we often turn to approximating them using methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. However, this is not the only way to approximate such PDFs. One alternative method is called Variational Inference (VI), which is a machine learning method that performs these approximations using optimization. VI does this by positing an entire family of potential density functions, then optimizes by finding the member of that family that most closely matches the data. To actually perform VI is no trivial task, especially so because many of the calculations required are intractable. So, to accomplish the optimization task that VI poses, we need to use an iterative algorithm that performs the optimization. One such algorithm is called the Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm. 1.2 Modeling Goal/Data The goal for this project is to apply CAVI towards models that we are already familiar with in an attempt to see if this can improve the interpretability of said models. Specifically, we will be implementing CAVI for linear regression and logistic regression. After successful implementation, these ML models will be trained and tested on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, where both regression and classification will be attempted. The specific regression task will tentatively be to predict a studentâ€™s score on a particular assessment and the classification task will be to classify which class a particular student would belong to. 1.3 Existing Literature: The task of applying CAVI to linear and logistic regression has been done in the past: Linear Regression with CAVI Logistic Regression with CAVI (pg. 9) and code available on github However, the existing literature makes no comment on the interpretability of the models and only does limited visualization. Additionally, the evaluation and training of these models was done on artificially generated data rather than real-world data. This project will address both of these points and contribute to the existing literature.
